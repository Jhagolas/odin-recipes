    <p><img src="/repos/odin-recipes/img/flank-steak-barbecue.webp" alt="well cooked piece of meat with barbecue sauce"></p>
    <p>An excellent piece of meat with a great flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic powder, ground ginger, green onion, and vegetable oil in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the flank steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove the flank steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Pour the remaining marinade into a small saucepan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the flank steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Once cooked, cover the steak with several sheets of aluminum foil, and set aside to rest for 10 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain.</li>
            <li>While the steak is resting, bring the marinade to a boil over medium-high heat. Pour the sauce over the sliced steak to serve.</li>
        </ol>
