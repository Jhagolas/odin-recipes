            <p>These cookies require no chill time, no mixers, and no flour! They're so fast, easy, and tasty, it's almost unbelievable!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
                <li>¾ cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>½ cup mini candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as mini M&M's®)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Mix together peanut butter, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar, egg, baking soda, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg until combined. Mix in mini chocolate M&Ms.</li>
                <li>Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of dough and place 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Flatten dough balls to about 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cookies begin to slightly crack, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool 10 minutes on baking sheets before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
        <p>I used a natural and unsweetened peanut butter for this recipe. Depending on the kind of peanut butter you use, you may need to adjust the amount of brown sugar and salt to better suit your tastes.</p>
