        <p>Sultanâ€™s delight (Hunkar begendi) is an Ottaman dish that consists of a lamb stew served over an eggplant-bechamel sauce. The resulting dish is indeed fit for royalty and wonderfully comforting.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h4>For the lamb stew</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 lbs lamb (from the leg), diced into roughly bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt (approx)</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp pepper (approx)</li>
                    <li>1 large onion (or 2 medium)</li>
                    <li>1/2 green pepper (or 1 whole, if small)</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 cups chopped tomatoes (recommend chopped fresh tomatoes, around 3, or if using canned, use crushed or finely chopped)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1 cup light stock or water</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>For the eggplant-bechamel</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 lbs eggplant (approx 3 med-large)</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp flour</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups milk (approx, warmed)</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 oz grated Parmesan, cheddar, or a blend of both</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season the pieces of lamb with salt and pepper. Dice the onion relatively finely and dice the pepper. Finely chop the garlic.</li>
                    <li>Warm the oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over a medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook for around 5 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the lamb chunks and brown on all sides. Then add the green pepper and garlic. Stir and cook for a couple more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomatoes, thyme, oregano and tomato paste to the pot. Stir to mix through and cook a minute. Then add the stock/water. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover with a lid, then reduce the heat so that the sauce is gently simmering. Leave to cook for around 1 hour, so that the lamb is tender. (You may want to have the lid only half-on for part of this time to help the liquid reduce a little.)</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, cook the eggplant. If possible, cook the eggplant on a grill/BBQ or over a gas burner. (You may want to cover around the burner with foil to catch any drips.) Alternatively, preheat the oven to 430F, prick the eggplant all over with a knife, and place it on a baking sheet or in a baking dish. Roast for around 40 minutes. In all cases, you are looking for the inside of the eggplant to become very soft, and if over grill/flame, the skin should be well-charred. Once cooked, leave the eggplant to cool so it is safe to handle and open.</li>
                    <li>Once cooled, cut open the eggplant skin and scoop out the flesh. Either roughly chop and mash the flesh for a coarser texture, or blend it up for a smoother paste. In both cases, once chopped, try to drain off as much liquid as you can from the flesh as this can make it sour. If you want a really smooth puree, you can press the mixture through a fine strainer to remove the seeds.</li>
                    <li>Make the bechamel: Melt the butter in a medium-small saucepan over a medium heat. Once melted, add the flour. Stir as it cooks for a couple minutes and becomes gently nutty smelling.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the milk and stir or whisk after each addition to make a smooth paste. Cook a minute or two more, as needed, to thicken slightly.</li>
                    <li>Remove the sauce from the heat, then add the cheese and stir through so that the cheese mixes in and melts. Add the eggplant puree and stir to mix evenly through. Season with a little salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>To serve, either spread some of the eggplant sauce over the bottom of individual plates or all of it on the bottom of a serving platter. In both cases, spread it out so it creates a bit of a bowl in the middle to hold the stew. Add the lamb stew in the middle of the eggplant sauce and serve with bread on the side.</li>
